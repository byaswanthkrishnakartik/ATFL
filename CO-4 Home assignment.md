Simplify the given grammar G:({S,A,B}, {a,b}, P,S) P: {S->abAB, A-
>bAB/, B->BAa/A/} with transition funtion, transition table, transition daiagram

## AI

To simplify the given grammar G:({S,A,B}, {a,b}, P,S), we can eliminate the epsilon productions and unit productions. After eliminating them, the simplified grammar is as follows:

```
S -> abAB
A -> bAB | BA | a
B -> BAa | A
```

Transition Function:
Let's define a transition function `δ` that maps `(state, input symbol)` to a set of states. For our simplified grammar, the transition function is defined as follows:

```
δ(q0, a) = {q1}
δ(q0, b) = {}      (no transition)
δ(q1, a) = {q3}
δ(q1, b) = {q2}
δ(q2, a) = {q3}
δ(q2, b) = {q2, q4}
δ(q3, a) = {q5}
δ(q3, b) = {}      (no transition)
δ(q4, a) = {q5}
δ(q4, b) = {q2, q4}
δ(q5, a) = {}
δ(q5, b) = {}

where
q0 = start state S
q1 = A appears after reading 'a' following S
q2 = B appears after reading 'b' following S
q3 = A appears after reading 'b' following q1
q4 = B appears after reading 'a' following q2
q5 = ends when no further input is read
```

Transition Table:

|  δ  |   a    |   b     |
|:---:|:-----:|:-------:|
| q0  |  q1   | ∅       |
| q1  |  q3   |   q2    |
| q2  |  q3   | q2, q4  |
| q3  |  q5   | ∅       |
| q4  |  q5   | q2, q4  |
| q5  |  ∅    |    ∅    |

Prove That the language L= {anbn cn/ n>=1} is not Context free using a
pumping lemma on CFL.including transition function,table and diagram

## AI

To prove that the language L = {anbn cn/ n>=1} is not context-free, we will use the pumping lemma for context-free languages.

Assume that L is context-free. Therefore, there exists a constant k from the pumping lemma such that any string w ∈ L with |w| ≥ k can be written as w = uvxyz where:

1. |vxy| ≤ k
2. |vy| ≥ 1
3. For all i ≥ 0, uv^ixy^iz ∈ L

Let w = a^k b^k c^k. Since w is in L and |w| = 3k ≥ k, by the pumping lemma, w can be written as w = uvxyz such that conditions 1-3 hold.

Now, consider the possible cases for vxy:

1. Both v and y contain only a's.
In this case, pumping v and y will change the number of a's in the first part of w (a^k), and the number of b's and c's in the second and third parts of w (b^k and c^k). This will result in a string that is not in L.

2. Both v and y contain only b's.
In this case, pumping v and y will change the number of b's in the second part of w (b^k) and the number of c's in the third part of w (c^k). This will result in a string that is not in L.

3. Both v and y contain only c's.
In this case, pumping v and y will change the number of c's in the third part of w (c^k). This will result in a string that is not in L.

4. v and y contain different types of symbols (i.e., a's and b's or b's and c's or a's and c's).
In this case, pumping v and y will break the pattern of an equal number of a's, b's, and c's in w. This will result in a string that is not in L.

Therefore, we have shown that no matter how we choose u, v, x, and y as long as they satisfy conditions 1-3, we can always find a value of i that makes the resulting string not in L. Therefore, L is not context-free.

Transition Function
Here is the transition function for the grammar:

S -> aSBc | ε
B -> bBc | ε

Construct PDA that accepts for the language L={wcwR / wε{a, b}*}}

## AI

Here is the PDA that accepts the language L = {wcw^R | w ε {a, b}*}:

1. The PDA reads the input string from the left to right.
2. For each symbol a or b it reads:
   * Pushes the symbol onto the stack
   * Moves to state 2
3. When the PDA reads the midpoint of the string and encounters $ (end of input) symbol, it moves to state 3.
4. In state 3, it pops out the symbols present on the stack until it reaches $.
5. After reaching $, the PDA proceeds to state 4 and starts reading the input string from the right end to left end.
6. For each symbol a or b it reads:
   * Compares it with the symbol popped out from the stack
   * If they are same, then it pops the symbol out from the stack
   * If they are not same, then PDA rejects the string.
7. When the PDA reaches the midpoint of the string again, it has an empty stack.
8. Finally, when the PDA reaches the end of input, it moves to state 5 and accepts.

The formal definition of the PDA can be described as follows:

**Q**: Set of States {q0, q1, q2, q3, q4}

**∑**: Input Alphabet {a, b, c}

**Γ**: Stack Alphabet {a, b, $}

**δ**: Transition Function

|       δ      |         a        |          b           |             c           |           ε          |
|:-----------:|:-------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:---------------:|
|     **q0**    |    (q1,a,$)   |    (q1,b,$)         |        -                 |     -                |

|     **q3**    |    (q4,$,a)  |  (q4,$,b)           |  -                           |(q3,$,$)         |
|     **q4**    |   (q4,a,a)    | (q4,b,b)            | -                            | (q3,$,$)         |
|     **q5**    |      -            |       -                   |               -              |      -                  |

- **q0**: Initial state. It moves to q1 for each input symbol read from the left end of the string.
- **q1**: Reads a's and b's from the input string and pushes them onto the stack. If c symbol is encountered, it moves to q2 by pushing $ onto the stack.
- **q2**: Only accepts λ and gets ready to start matching with right side mirror image.
- **q3**: Matches each a or b from the right end with the character on the top of the stack. If they match, then it pops that character out of the stack and keeps going left. Otherwise, it enters into reject state q5.
- **q4**: Keeps moving left until reaching the starting midpoint $ symbol. At this point, the whole string has been accepted. 
- **q5**: Reject state.

This PDA recognizes the language L = {wcw^R | w ε {a, b}*}.

transition fConstruct a TM that for the language L ={anbn/ n>=1}

## AI

Here is the TM that accepts the language L = {anbn | n ≥ 1}:

**Q**: Set of States {start, check_a, mark_b, check_b, reject, accept}

**∑**: Input Alphabet {a, b }

**δ**: Transition Function

|    δ     |      a         |         b        |       ε          |       X         |
|:--------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:---------------:|:-------------:|
|**start** | (check_a, X, R) | -                 | -                    | -                |
|**check_a** |   (check_a, a, R)| (mark_b, X, R)| -                    | -                |
|**mark_b** | (check_b, X, R)| (mark_b, b, R) | -                    | -                 |
|**check_b** |  (check_b, b, R)| -                    | (goto_accept, X, L) | -              |
|**reject** | -                   | -                   |  -                     | -               |
|**accept** |  -                  |  -                  |     -                  | -               |

- **start**: Initial state, it moves to check_a state by replacing first `a` with `X`.
- **check_a**: Scans the input string for 'a' and replaces it with `X`. Then it moves onto the next symbol to check if it's `b` or not, by moving right.
- **mark_b**: Replaces every `b` encountered on scanning with `X`, and move right until it reaches the end of string, marked by a blank space.
- **check_b**: Scans the string from right to left, to make sure there are as many `b`s as there are `a`s. If at any point there are more `a`s than `b`s, the machine rejects. If it encounters a non-blank character while looking for the beginning of the string, it moves to reject state. Otherwise, it marks the beginning of the string with `X` and moves left.
- **reject**: The machine enters this state if it senses an input that doesn’t fit in the language description or gets stuck midway without reaching the acceptance or rejection states by having a transition from its current configuration to some undefined configuration. In this case, it loops on any symbol being scanned and moves right endlessly.
- **accept**: The final state, where the input string satisfies the given language rules.

This TM works based on the following approach:
1. When it sees the first 'a', it replaces it with 'X' and moves to the next state.
2. It then scans the string right until it reaches the end of string, marking each 'b' with 'X', so now we have Xn in the input tape.
3. Then it goes back to the start of the string and checks whether the number of `a`s is equal to the number of `b`s. If they match, it accepts the input. Otherwise, it rejects.

This TM recognizes the language L = {anbn | n ≥ 1}.

Construct PDA that accepts for the language L={anb3n / n>=0}

## AI

Here is the PDA that accepts the language L = {anb3n | n ≥ 0}:

**Q**: Set of states {q0, q1, q2, q3}

**∑**: Input alphabet {a, b}

**Γ**: Stack alphabet {A, B, Z}, where A, B ∈ {a, b} *

**δ**: Transition function

| **q3**        | -         | -         | -         |

- **q0**: Initial state. It pushes a Z onto the stack, moves to q1, and reads the first symbol.
- **q1**: Processes any number of contiguous a's by pushing A's onto the stack, and any number of contiguous b's by pushing B's onto the stack. When it encounters ε (empty string), it moves to q3 which is an accepting state, and pops a Z from the stack.
- **q2**: Reads three b's in order as it processes the b's pushed onto the stack. If any additional b is encountered, the automaton enters a non-final sink state.
- **q3**: Final (accepting) state. 

The PDA works based on the following approach:
1. The pushdown symbol A is used to count the number of a's read from the input tape
2. The pushdown symbol B is used to count the number of b's read from the input tape
3. The pushdown symbol Z is used as an endmarker, indicating that we have read all the symbols on the stack corresponding to the number of a's or b's read from the input tape.

When the PDA reads a symbol `a`, it pushes an `A` onto the stack and moves to state `q1`. When it reads a symbol `b`, it pushes a `B` onto the stack and moves to state `q1`. Once it has finished reading the input string, it enters state `q3` which signifies that the input string is accepted if there are 3 times as many `B`s on the stack as there were `A`s. If any additional `B` is encountered, the automaton enters a non-final sink state showing that the language rules are not satisfied.

Thus, this PDA recognizes the language L = {anb3n | n ≥ 0}.

Apply CYK algorithm for the following grammar
S->AB|BC
A->BA|a
B->CC|b
C->AB|a

## AI

To apply the CYK algorithm, we need to convert the given grammar to Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). 

First, we introduce new variables for each terminal:
```
S -> AB | BC
A -> BD | a
B -> EE | b
C -> AF | a
D -> C
E -> CC
F -> AB
```

Next, we eliminate productions that are not in CNF. We do this as follows:

1. Eliminate ε-productions
```
None of the productions generate ε.
```

2. Eliminate unit productions
```
None of the productions have unit productions.
```

3. Convert RHS with more than 2 variables into multiple productions
```
None of the productions have more than 2 variables on the right-hand side.
```

4. Convert terminals on the RHS into productions
```
None of the productions have terminals on the right-hand side that need to be replaced.
```

Now we construct the table for the CYK algorithm for the input string 'abbaa':
```
   +---+---+---+---+---+
   |   | a | b | b | a |
+--+---+---+---+---+---+
|  |   | A | B | B | A |
+--+---+---+---+---+---+
|  |   |   | E | E |   |
+--+---+---+---+---+---+
|  |   |   | C | C |   |
+--+---+---+---+---+---+
|  |   |   | F |   | C |
+--+---+---+---+---+---+

```

Starting from the bottom row of the table, we fill in the entries of the table according to the following rules:

1. For each terminal symbol in the input string, we fill in the corresponding cell(s) of the table with the nonterminal symbol(s) that generate that terminal symbol.
2. For each pair of cells (i,j) where i < j, we consider all possible productions with a right-hand-side consisting of the nonterminal symbols in the cells (i,k) and (k+1,j) for some k between i and j-1. If there is any such production,
   we add the left-hand-side nonterminal symbol to the cell (i,j).
   
Using this procedure, we can fill in the entire table.

The top-right entry of the table is 'S', which indicates that the input string 'abbaa' can be generated by the start symbol 'S'. 

Therefore, the CYK algorithm accepts the string 'abbaa'.
